# Customer Segmentation Analysis & Suggested Marketing Techniques For Different Groups of Supermarkets Customers ðŸš€ðŸš€

## 1. Project Summary

The project objective is to perform a customer segmentation analysis for a large supermarket chain. 
The task involves analyzing a dataset of 4000 customers, collected through loyalty cards, which includes variables such as customer age, gender, annual income, etc. 
The goal is to identify distinct customer segments using clustering analysis techniques (K-Means++ and Agglomerative clustering) in Python and present the findings in a concise and informative report.

The key tasks include:

- Clearly define the problem and explain the purpose of the report, which is to analyze customer segmentation for effective marketing strategies.

- Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis, presenting summary statistics and relevant insights gained from the dataset.

- Apply clustering techniques (K-Means++ and Agglomerative clustering) to identify customer segments within the dataset.

- Determine the optimal number of clusters using appropriate methods and interpret the clusters in terms of customer profiles.

- Provide actionable marketing recommendations tailored to each customer segment based on the segmentation analysis.

- Summarize the key findings and emphasize the importance of customer segmentation for enhancing marketing strategies.

The deliverables include a professional PDF report, up to 1000 words, with informative tables and figures, along with a Jupyter Notebook containing well-organized Python code for the analysis. The report should be designed to be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders, enabling the supermarket chain to improve customer engagement and drive sales through targeted marketing efforts.
